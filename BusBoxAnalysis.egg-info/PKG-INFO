BusBoxAnalysis
========
BusBoxAnalysis is a project in the Nautiyal Lab at Dartmouth college for writing operant paradigm analysis scripts 
for Bussey-Saksida Raw data files. This project will work toward analyzing mouse behavior in various experimental groups across days, as well as in
varying paradigms, with a focus on applying Reinforcement Learning model-fitting techniques to dynamic foraging data.
