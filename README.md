# BusseyBoxAnalysis-Python
========
 This project will work toward analyzing mouse behavior in various experimental groups across days, as well as in varying paradigms. 

 A suite of core tools will be used to read in raw data files as DataFrames and extract data from those Frames. Specialized modules will be used for analyses of individual behavioral paradigms (e.g. 5CSRTT, dynamic foraging, etc.). 

 This package is currently in Alpha, and functionality is being actively updated.
